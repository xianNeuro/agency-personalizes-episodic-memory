PERMUTATION TEST FOR RECALL ISC
================================================================================

Method: Non-parametric permutation test
  - Randomly sampled 1 Yoked and 1 Passive participant from each of 18 story-paths
  - Repeated 10,000 times to generate distributions
  - Compared Free condition's Recall ISC to these distributions

Random seed: 42 (for reproducibility)

================================================================================
ANALYSIS: 64 Shared Events
================================================================================

Free condition mean ISC: 0.1364

Permutation distributions:
  Yoked: Mean = 0.2185, Std = 0.0201, N = 10000
  Passive: Mean = 0.2531, Std = 0.0180, N = 10000

Statistical tests:
  Free vs Yoked: p = 0.000000 (proportion of Yoked samples below Free mean)
    Result: Free ISC significantly lower than Yoked (p < 0.001)

  Free vs Passive: p = 0.000000 (proportion of Passive samples below Free mean)
    Result: Free ISC significantly lower than Passive (p < 0.001)

  Yoked vs Passive: t = -128.3238, p = 0.000000
    Result: Significant difference (p < 0.001)

    Result: Significant difference (p < 0.001)
