## RUN 1: Agency did not improve recall performance



For each participant, events were binned according to whether they were remembered or forgotten.
Independent raters compared each sentence of recall to the story path read by the participant;
if any part of a given event was mentioned in any recall sentence, it was counted as remembered.

**Statistical Results:**
```

Adventure: F(2,113) = 1.433, p = 0.243

Romance: F(2,123) = 0.671, p = 0.513
```


There were no significant differences in recall performance across conditions in either story
(**Adventure: F(2,113)=1.43, p=0.243**;
**Romance: F(2,123)=0.67, p=0.513**;
*Supplementary Figure S3*). The Romance story additionally recorded
individual reading speed and showed no difference across the three agency conditions (ps> .3;
see **Supplement S3** for details). See **Supplement S4**
for details about memory for choice and non-choice events; See **Supplement S5**
for details about recognition memory performance; See **Supplement S6**
for details about memory for denied and granted choice events.

## RUN 2: Individual variability in recalled events



**Agency magnified individual variability in recall and choice.** The Romance story,
by design, had half of its events shared across all participants ("shared story sections"),
regardless of condition (*Figure 1A*). While participants made many
choices during these shared story sections, unbeknownst to them, all choice options led to the
same subsequent events. This allowed us to examine inter-participant variability in terms of
memory (which events were recalled) and choice behavior (which options were selected) when all
events were perfectly matched across participants, i.e., all participants read these events,
and the events were composed of identical text.



**Individual variability in recalled events.** A recall score (0 = Forgotten, 1 = Recalled;
see Methods for details) for each of the 64 events in the shared story sections was extracted for each
participant, composing a vector of recall performance (*Figure 2A*).
To assess the memory similarity across participants, we computed the inter-participant correlation (ISC),
i.e., the Pearson correlation between each pair of participants' recall performance vectors, i.e.,
"Recall ISC".

While events differed in their overall memorability, Recall ISC was significantly above zero
in all three conditions (**Romance: Free: mean r = 0.136, p .3); however, higher percentage of choices granted predicted greater
individual tendency to forget the choice-denied events (Adventure: r(44) = .335, p = .026. Romance: r(51) = .137,
p = .337; see **Supplement S7** for details).



Together, these results suggest that in a context lacking full agentive control, perceived agency and their
effects on memory could vary across individuals in non-systematic ways. The one exception is that with more control
in such agency-uncertain contexts, the more one has reduced recall for the agency-denied events.
