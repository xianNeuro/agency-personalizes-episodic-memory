        <div class="manuscript-text">
            <p>For each participant, events were binned according to whether they were remembered or forgotten. 
            Independent raters compared each sentence of recall to the story path read by the participant; 
            if any part of a given event was mentioned in any recall sentence, it was counted as remembered.</p>

            <span class="figure-ref">Supplementary Figure S3</span>). The Romance story additionally recorded 
            individual reading speed and showed no difference across the three agency conditions (ps> .3;

        <h2>RUN 2: Individual variability in recalled events</h2>
        <div class="manuscript-text">
            <p><strong>Agency magnified individual variability in recall and choice.</strong> The Romance story, 
            by design, had half of its events shared across all participants ("shared story sections"), 
            regardless of condition (<span class="figure-ref">Figure 1A</span>). While participants made many 
            choices during these shared story sections, unbeknownst to them, all choice options led to the 
            same subsequent events. This allowed us to examine inter-participant variability in terms of 
            memory (which events were recalled) and choice behavior (which options were selected) when all 
            events were perfectly matched across participants, i.e., all participants read these events, 
            and the events were composed of identical text.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Individual variability in recalled events.</strong> A recall score (0 = Forgotten, 1 = Recalled; 
            see Methods for details) for each of the 64 events in the shared story sections was extracted for each 
            participant, composing a vector of recall performance (<span class="figure-ref">Figure 2A</span>). 
            To assess the memory similarity across participants, we computed the inter-participant correlation (ISC), 
            i.e., the Pearson correlation between each pair of participants' recall performance vectors, i.e., 
            "Recall ISC".</p>

            <p>While events differed in their overall memorability, Recall ISC was significantly above zero 
            in all three conditions (<span class="stat-inline">Romance: Free: mean r = 0.136, p < 0.001</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Yoked: mean r = 0.226, p < 0.001</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Passive: mean r = 0.249, p < 0.001</span>; one-sample t-tests against zero), 
            indicating that individuals tended to remember events more similarly to one another than would be 
            expected by chance.</p>
            
            <p>Interestingly, when comparing across the conditions, Free participants had reduced Recall ISC 
            relative to Yoked and Passive participants, indicating that agency induced greater individual variability 
            in terms of which events were recalled (<span class="figure-ref">Figure 2B, left</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Romance: F(2,3013) = 48.1, p < .001</span>; post-hoc tests: 
            <span class="stat-inline">Free vs. Passive: p < 0.001</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Free vs. Yoked: p < 0.001</span>).</p>
            
            <p>Out of the 64 events, 15 were "choice events" (the event that the participant chose to occur, 
            e.g., "Sleep beneath the bridge" in <span class="figure-ref">Figure 1B</span>). To examine whether 
            the reduced Recall ISC observed among Free participants was driven by these choice events, we repeated 
            the analysis using only the 49 non-choice events. The results were largely unchanged: Recall ISC was 
            still significantly above zero in all three conditions (<span class="stat-inline">Romance: Free: mean r = 0.157, p < 0.001</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Yoked: mean r = 0.219, p < 0.001</span>; 
            <span class="stat-inline">Passive: mean r = 0.229, p < 0.001</span>; one-sample t-tests against zero), 
            and the Free condition continued to show reduced Recall ISC relative to the Yoked and Passive conditions 
            (<span class="figure-ref">Figure 2C, left</span>; <span class="stat-inline">Romance: F(2,3013) = 15.4, p < 0.001</span>;

        <h2>RUN 12: Permutation test for Recall ISC</h2>
        <div class="manuscript-text">
            <p>In the Yoked and Passive conditions, multiple participants followed the story-path corresponding 
            to each of the 18 unique Free participant story-paths. To ensure that the above-reported higher 
            inter-participant memory similarity in the Yoked and Passive conditions was not due to participants 
            sharing the same story-path, we conducted non-parametric tests of Recall ISC 
            (<span class="figure-ref">Figure 2B-C</span>). We randomly sampled one Yoked and one Passive participant 
            from each of the 18 story-paths to form a sample of 18 Yoked and 18 Passive participants; thus, no pairs 
            within these samples read the same story-path. This process was repeated 10,000 times to generate 
            distributions of Recall ISC for both the Yoked and Passive conditions.</p>

        <h2>RUN 5: Event recall was predicted by semantic and causal centrality</h2>
        <div class="manuscript-text">
            <p>Narrative networks were computed for each unique story path following the methods of Lee & Chen. 
            For semantic narrative network analysis, each event was converted into an embedding vector using the 
            Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). Semantic centrality, a measure of how strongly interconnected a 
            given event was with other events in the narrative via shared meaning, was calculated for each event 
            by averaging its embedding cosine similarity with all other events in the story path. The effect of 
            semantic centrality (semantic influence) on memory was computed as the Pearson correlation between 
            semantic centrality and recall (an event-by-event vector of remembered=1, forgotten=0) for each participant.</p>

            <p>We examined whether recall performance for a given event could be predicted by whether its temporally

            on only one side, and thus these entries consisted merely of recall performance for the next and previous 
            event, respectively. This procedure generated a vector of neighbor recall performance for each participant.
